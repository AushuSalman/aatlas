# Decisions made while scaffolding

Short record of the choices that were not obvious, so the next person does not have to rediscover the reasoning — or worse, quietly undo it.

## Spring Boot 3.5.16, not 4.1

Boot 4.1 is GA. It was not chosen because springdoc, Spring Modulith and ShedLock all have their Boot 4 lines at milestone quality today, and the OpenAPI generator is load-bearing here — it is what stops the frontend's view models and the backend's DTOs from drifting. 3.5.16 is the newest release where every dependency in this stack is stable *together*.

Nothing in the code is designed around 3.x specifics. When the ecosystem settles, the upgrade is a version bump plus the Spring Framework 7 migration.

## Modular monolith, module boundaries enforced at build time

Straight from the blueprint, and worth restating: fifteen microservices would spend the first six months on plumbing. But "modular monolith" is only a real thing if something checks — otherwise the sixteen packages are a filing convention that erodes the first time someone reaches into another module's internals under deadline.

`ModularityTests` is that check. `common` and `config` are declared shared modules; everything else may only touch another module's package-root types.

---

## The Modulith events store is JDBC, not JPA

`spring-modulith-starter-jpa` maps the outbox as a JPA entity, which `ddl-auto: validate` then polices — so the schema of a framework-owned table becomes something this project has to keep in lockstep by hand.

The JDBC variant ships its own `schema-postgresql.sql`, copied verbatim into `V3__event_publication.sql`. Flyway owns the schema, one owner, and a framework upgrade that changes the table is a reviewed migration rather than a surprise at startup.

Same reasoning for `V2__spring_batch.sql`: taken verbatim from `spring-batch-core`, with `spring.batch.jdbc.initialize-schema: never`.

## Servlet filters are registered explicitly, never `@Component`

**This one bit during setup, and the failure mode is opaque.**

Spring Modulith's observability module proxies beans that live in application modules so it can trace calls between them. CGLIB cannot override `GenericFilterBean.init()` because it is `final`, so the proxy's `init` runs against uninitialised state, the filter fails to start, and Tomcat comes down with:

```
One or more Filters failed to start. Full details will be found in the appropriate container log file
```

— which names neither the filter nor the cause. The only hint is a `WARN` from `CglibAopProxy` several hundred lines earlier.

`TenantContextFilter` is therefore constructed in `WebConfig` and registered through a `FilterRegistrationBean`. **Any filter added later must do the same.** Explicit ordering is a real benefit too: the tenant filter must run after Spring Security has validated the JWT, and saying so in one place beats an `@Order` plus an assumption.

---

## `uuid_generate_v7()` rather than `gen_random_uuid()`

Random v4 keys scatter inserts across the whole B-tree. For a 24-month import that means random I/O and a bloated index; for the ledger, history and audit log — all read newest-first — it means the rows a query wants are spread over the whole heap.

v7 keys sort by creation time, so inserts stay at the right-hand edge of the index and recent rows cluster. PostgreSQL 18 has this built in, but the function is defined here so the schema also applies to 16 and 17.

---

## Row-level security is wired but off

`aatlas.rls.enabled=false` until the migrations that create the policies exist. The `TenantAwareDataSource` decorator, `app.current_tenant()` and `app.enable_tenant_rls()` are all in place, so switching it on is a config change plus one line per table.

The wiring lands before the policies deliberately: retrofitting the connection-level tenant binding after sixty tables exist is a much larger change than having it ready.

Note that `scripts/create-database.sql` creates a **non-superuser** role. RLS is bypassed by superusers and by the table owner, so developing as one would make the policies silently useless locally and hide a bug that only shows up in production.

---

## Two test phases

`mvn test` runs unit and architecture tests: fast, no Docker, safe to run on every save. `mvn verify` adds `*IT` tests against a real PostgreSQL via Testcontainers.

Real PostgreSQL, not H2 — the schema uses extensions, `jsonb`, partitioning and row-level security, so an H2 test would only prove the migrations apply to something this application never runs on.

The integration tests skip rather than fail where Docker is absent (`@Testcontainers(disabledWithoutDocker = true)`), so a developer without Docker Desktop can still run everything else. CI has Docker and runs the lot.

---

## `archRule.failOnEmptyShould=false`, for now

Most architecture rules currently match no classes, because the modules are empty. Failing on that would mean deleting the rules until the code they guard exists — backwards: the rule should be in place before the first line it governs is written.

**Flip this to `true` once the modules have code**, so a rule that silently stops matching anything (a renamed package, say) is reported instead of quietly passing.

---

## Suppliers module (V8)

Ports `intel/suppliers.ts`, `intel/terms.ts` and `intel/buy2.ts`'s `supplierRisk` to Java, with seven tables under `suppliers`/`suppliers.internal`.

**Certifications live on `supplier_terms`, not `suppliers`.** The frontend's `SupplierProfile.certifications` is really a profile fact, but the table that already exists for one-to-one-with-a-supplier data with room for order-mechanics columns (MOQ, order multiple, quality PPM, response hours — none of which are in the ported TypeScript, but all of which the seed JSON's `record` carries and a later Buy-side compare will want) is `supplier_terms`. Putting a second `certifications` column on `suppliers` for the same list would be two places that can drift; `SupplierProfileView` reads it from `supplier_terms` when assembling the wire shape either way.

**`supplier_terms`, `supplier_ratings` and `supplier_risk` key off the supplier's own id**, not a fresh uuid: there is exactly one row per supplier by definition, and a second key would only be something to keep in sync. `UuidV7Generator` honours an id assigned explicitly (see its javadoc — imports and tests already rely on this), so the constructor just sets `supplierId = supplier.getId()` before insert rather than fighting `@GeneratedValue`.

**The seeder stamps `tenant_id` explicitly, never via `TenantScopedEntity`'s `@PrePersist`.** The public seam other modules call, `SupplierPanelSeeder.seedForTenant(tenantId)`, is invoked by an `@ApplicationModuleListener` running on a Modulith worker thread, which does not inherit `TenantContext`'s `InheritableThreadLocal` — that only propagates at thread *creation*, and the listener's thread pool is created once, long before any tenant exists. Every row the seeder writes sets `tenantId` by hand for this reason. The read/write paths reachable from a real request (the controller and service) still rely on `TenantContext`, exactly per convention, since `TenantContextFilter` has already bound it there.

**The trigger is a local stand-in, on purpose.** `com.aatlas.ingest.SampleDataConnected` — the real event — is owned by another builder's worktree and is not visible here. `SuppliersSeedRequested(tenantId)` is a record in this module's own package root that `SuppliersSeedListener` listens for instead; `POST /api/v1/suppliers/seed` (director only) calls the same seeder directly so the path is exercisable today. `SuppliersSeedRequested`'s javadoc carries a `TODO(merge)` naming exactly what to retarget.

**`GET /suppliers/{id}` and friends take the frontend's id (`sup-2`, `cus-f26j4f`), never the row's uuid.** Every seeded figure for a supplier — its defect rate, its stock position, its terms, its risk — hashes that string, so it is what the frontend already has and what every screen navigates by; the internal uuid never appears on the wire.

**Test-only clock override in `SuppliersIT`.** `application-test.yml` freezes `AatlasClock` at 2026-09-01 for golden-file determinism; `TokenService` stamps a JWT's `iat`/`exp` from that clock, but the `JwtDecoder` bean validates them against the real system clock. In this sandbox the real clock has since passed 2026-09-01 plus the 15-minute access-token TTL, so any token minted under the frozen test clock decodes as already expired — reproducible from a clean checkout with `-Dit.test=SignupIT` alone (no suppliers code involved): `SignupIT.tokenCarriesTenantAndRole` fails the same way, as does `SignupIT.duplicateEmailIsRejected` on an unrelated pre-existing issue. Neither is caused by this module, and neither is touched by it; `SuppliersIT` instead overrides `aatlas.clock.fixed=false` for its own Spring context via `@TestPropertySource`, which is why its own token-authenticated calls work in the same run. Worth the shared scaffold fixing centrally before more builders hit it.

**Order-mechanics columns (`moq`, `order_multiple`, `quality_ppm`, `response_hours`) are populated but not on the wire.** The seeded panel gets them from `seed/suppliers.json`'s `record`; a supplier added from a lookup gets simple deterministic defaults (`moq`/`order_multiple` = 1, `quality_ppm` derived from the defect rate, `response_hours` seeded). None of the four are part of `CommercialTerms` in `intel/terms.ts`, so `GET /{id}/terms` does not return them — they are there for whichever module builds the Buy-side compare next.
