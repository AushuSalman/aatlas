# Decisions made while scaffolding

Short record of the choices that were not obvious, so the next person does not have to rediscover the reasoning — or worse, quietly undo it.

## Spring Boot 3.5.16, not 4.1

Boot 4.1 is GA. It was not chosen because springdoc, Spring Modulith and ShedLock all have their Boot 4 lines at milestone quality today, and the OpenAPI generator is load-bearing here — it is what stops the frontend's view models and the backend's DTOs from drifting. 3.5.16 is the newest release where every dependency in this stack is stable *together*.

Nothing in the code is designed around 3.x specifics. When the ecosystem settles, the upgrade is a version bump plus the Spring Framework 7 migration.

## Modular monolith, module boundaries enforced at build time

Straight from the blueprint, and worth restating: fifteen microservices would spend the first six months on plumbing. But "modular monolith" is only a real thing if something checks — otherwise the sixteen packages are a filing convention that erodes the first time someone reaches into another module's internals under deadline.

`ModularityTests` is that check. `common` and `config` are declared shared modules; everything else may only touch another module's package-root types.

---

## The Modulith events store is JDBC, not JPA

`spring-modulith-starter-jpa` maps the outbox as a JPA entity, which `ddl-auto: validate` then polices — so the schema of a framework-owned table becomes something this project has to keep in lockstep by hand.

The JDBC variant ships its own `schema-postgresql.sql`, copied verbatim into `V3__event_publication.sql`. Flyway owns the schema, one owner, and a framework upgrade that changes the table is a reviewed migration rather than a surprise at startup.

Same reasoning for `V2__spring_batch.sql`: taken verbatim from `spring-batch-core`, with `spring.batch.jdbc.initialize-schema: never`.

## Servlet filters are registered explicitly, never `@Component`

**This one bit during setup, and the failure mode is opaque.**

Spring Modulith's observability module proxies beans that live in application modules so it can trace calls between them. CGLIB cannot override `GenericFilterBean.init()` because it is `final`, so the proxy's `init` runs against uninitialised state, the filter fails to start, and Tomcat comes down with:

```
One or more Filters failed to start. Full details will be found in the appropriate container log file
```

— which names neither the filter nor the cause. The only hint is a `WARN` from `CglibAopProxy` several hundred lines earlier.

`TenantContextFilter` is therefore constructed in `WebConfig` and registered through a `FilterRegistrationBean`. **Any filter added later must do the same.** Explicit ordering is a real benefit too: the tenant filter must run after Spring Security has validated the JWT, and saying so in one place beats an `@Order` plus an assumption.

---

## `uuid_generate_v7()` rather than `gen_random_uuid()`

Random v4 keys scatter inserts across the whole B-tree. For a 24-month import that means random I/O and a bloated index; for the ledger, history and audit log — all read newest-first — it means the rows a query wants are spread over the whole heap.

v7 keys sort by creation time, so inserts stay at the right-hand edge of the index and recent rows cluster. PostgreSQL 18 has this built in, but the function is defined here so the schema also applies to 16 and 17.

---

## Row-level security is wired but off

`aatlas.rls.enabled=false` until the migrations that create the policies exist. The `TenantAwareDataSource` decorator, `app.current_tenant()` and `app.enable_tenant_rls()` are all in place, so switching it on is a config change plus one line per table.

The wiring lands before the policies deliberately: retrofitting the connection-level tenant binding after sixty tables exist is a much larger change than having it ready.

Note that `scripts/create-database.sql` creates a **non-superuser** role. RLS is bypassed by superusers and by the table owner, so developing as one would make the policies silently useless locally and hide a bug that only shows up in production.

---

## Two test phases

`mvn test` runs unit and architecture tests: fast, no Docker, safe to run on every save. `mvn verify` adds `*IT` tests against a real PostgreSQL via Testcontainers.

Real PostgreSQL, not H2 — the schema uses extensions, `jsonb`, partitioning and row-level security, so an H2 test would only prove the migrations apply to something this application never runs on.

The integration tests skip rather than fail where Docker is absent (`@Testcontainers(disabledWithoutDocker = true)`), so a developer without Docker Desktop can still run everything else. CI has Docker and runs the lot.

---

## `archRule.failOnEmptyShould=false`, for now

Most architecture rules currently match no classes, because the modules are empty. Failing on that would mean deleting the rules until the code they guard exists — backwards: the rule should be in place before the first line it governs is written.

**Flip this to `true` once the modules have code**, so a rule that silently stops matching anything (a renamed package, say) is reported instead of quietly passing.

---

## Wave 1: `identity` (rest of auth), `tenant`, `policy`, guardrails

### `tenant_settings` is the source of truth for country and currency

`tenants.country` / `tenants.trading_currency` predate `tenant_settings` (`V4` vs `V5`) and the session, `/me` and every report already read them from `tenants`. Rather than migrate every reader, `V5` adds `tenant_settings` as the row `TenantService` actually writes to, and the same transaction copies the result onto `tenants` (`TenantEntity.mirror`). Two columns can only disagree inside a transaction that then rolls back. If a future module needs the country or currency, it should read `TenantDirectory.get(tenantId)` (backed by `tenants`) rather than reaching into `tenant_settings` directly — one reason less for the copy to matter.

### Currency is no longer pinned to the tenant's country

The frontend supports ten trading currencies (`src/lib/platform/money.ts`), but `V4`'s `tenants_currency_ck` only allowed `USD`/`GBP` — the pair the two supported countries imply. `V5` relaxes that constraint to the full ten and backfills `tenant_settings` from the existing `tenants` rows in the same migration, so `PUT /tenant/settings` can set any of them independently of country (a US company can trade in EUR).

### `role_policy` replaces per-seat constants

`SeatRole` used to carry title, side, level, bulk, guardrails and approval limit as enum constructor arguments — fine until a tenant needs its own buyer limit. `V5` seeds `role_policy` from `seed/personas.json` (`tenant_id null` = platform default) and `SeatRole` shrank back down to the closed set of eight wire values; everything else is `PolicyReader.personaFor(tenantId, role)`, read fresh per request so a tenant override needs no deploy. `identity` depends on `policy` for this (not the other way around): the JWT carries the role's wire value, not the enum, so there is no cycle to break.

### `Persona.isHeadOrDirector()` needed `@JsonIgnore`

Jackson treats any no-arg `isXxx()` method as a bean property, records included — not just the canonical component accessors. Without `@JsonIgnore` this derived helper leaked into `/me` and `/roles` as an extra `headOrDirector` key the frontend's `Persona` type does not have. Caught by hand while curling the running app, not by a test; worth remembering for the next boolean helper added to a record that also serialises.

### `Map.copyOf` does not preserve insertion order

`ReferenceData` built its `countries` and `currencies` lookups with a `LinkedHashMap` and then wrapped them in `Map.copyOf(...)`. `Map.copyOf` (like `Map.of`) salts its hashing per JVM run for flood resistance, so the returned map's iteration order has no relation to the input's — `GET /reference/currencies` came back in a different, wrong order every restart instead of the seed's `USD, GBP, EUR, ...`. Fixed with `Collections.unmodifiableMap`, which does not copy or reorder. `ReferenceIT.currenciesIsPublicAndOrdered` pins the order so this cannot silently come back.

### The JWT decoder now validates against `AatlasClock`, not the system clock

`TokenService` mints `exp`/`iat`/`nbf` from `AatlasClock`, which is exactly right — it is what lets the demo tenant's tokens make sense under a frozen "now". But `NimbusJwtDecoder`'s default timestamp validator checks the *system* clock. The two clocks only ever agreed by coincidence (`local` and `prod` do not fix the clock, so `AatlasClock` tracks the system clock there anyway); the `test` profile freezes "now" at 1 September 2026, so **every** token minted in a test decoded as already-expired the moment anything validated it — signup worked (it never decodes its own token), but any IT that authenticated against a second endpoint failed with `Jwt expired`. `JwtConfig.jwtDecoder` now builds its validator with `JwtTimestampValidator.setClock(aatlasClock.clock())`, so minting and verification ask the same clock the same question. No behaviour change in `local`/`prod`.

### Two scaffold review fixes, both in `JwtConfig`

`/actuator/health` was already reachable unauthenticated — `SecurityConfig.PUBLIC` lists it ahead of the blanket `/actuator/** → ROLE_platform_admin` rule, and Spring Security matches in order, so that one was already correct. The other was not: `JwtConfig.rsaKey` generated a throwaway key pair whenever `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`/`JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` were unset, logging a warning but starting anyway — fine for a laptop, wrong for `prod`, where every pod would mint its own key and nothing would agree on token validity across pods. It now throws `IllegalStateException` and refuses to start under `spring.profiles.active=prod` specifically; `local`/`dev`/`test` keep the ephemeral-key fallback.

### `@Email` runs before the service gets to `.strip()`

`SignupRequest`, `LoginRequest` and `ForgotPasswordRequest`'s Javadoc promised padding and case would be normalised — true once a request reaches `SignupService`/`SessionService`, which call `.strip()` — but Jakarta's `@Email` validates the raw bound value first, and its pattern does not tolerate a leading or trailing space. A client that pastes a padded address got "not a valid email address" instead of a normal sign-in. Fixed with a record compact constructor (`email = email.strip()`) on all three, which runs before the accessor bean validation reads from, so the constraint sees the same string the service would have produced anyway. `SignupIT.duplicateEmailIsRejected`, which posts a padded, upper-cased duplicate on purpose, is what caught this.
